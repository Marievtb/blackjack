A basic implementation of this project should probably include:

A way to keep track of the current player bankroll ( a player should be able to play multiple hands and the bankroll should reflect wins and losses)
A way for players to make a bet
A way for players to get more cards, or declare themselves happy with their current hand
A way for players to bust
A way for players to win or tie
Game logic for the dealer to hit until a certain point

Most importantly a technical demonstration of your app which:

Is 5 minutes in length
Shows off all features of the app
Explains the technical details

if card1 + card2 > 21 = bust;
else if(p1card1.value + p1card2.value === p2card1.value + p2card2.value){
	tie"!
}
_________
if card1 + card2 < 21, player can choose to 'hit' --> <!-- or 'stand'.
